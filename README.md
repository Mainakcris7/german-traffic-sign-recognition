# German Traffic Sign Recognition

Welcome to the German Traffic Sign Recognition project! This repository contains a robust deep learning-based system for accurately identifying and classifying German traffic signs. The project achieves an outstanding accuracy rate of over `96%`, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Leveraging a simple `CNN` model, this solution contributes to improved road safety by providing reliable and fast traffic sign recognition. The repository includes comprehensive documentation, code, and pretrained models, enabling users to understand, reproduce, and extend the capabilities of this successful traffic sign recognition system. Feel free to explore, contribute, and integrate this solution into your own projects!
